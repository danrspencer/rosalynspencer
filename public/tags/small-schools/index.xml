      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why I Started a Small School&amp;rdquo; tells the story of my journey in setting up and running a non-fee paying &amp;lsquo;alternative&amp;rsquo; small school. This book draws from my extensive experience of over 25 years in teaching, working with children from various backgrounds and educational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book explores the challenges and rewards of creating an educational environment that focuses on the individual needs of children, particularly those who have struggled in mainstream education. It shares insights from my experience visiting fifteen small schools affiliated with Human Scale Education during a ten-week caravan journey through England and Scotland with my two children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journey was not only pivotal in kick-starting my writing career but also formed the basis for my Masters Degree in Education by Research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why I Started a Small School&amp;rdquo; is the culmination of my life&amp;rsquo;s work in education, sharing the story of how I created an educational environment focused on individual needs. The book offers insights into alternative approaches to education, especially for children who have not thrived in conventional school settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative draws from my diverse experiences including working with struggling students, teenagers in care, running a children&amp;rsquo;s nursery, home educating my own children, and ultimately establishing a small school. It chronicles the challenges, rewards, and lessons learned throughout this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book reflects my belief in the importance of educational environments that recognize and nurture each child&amp;rsquo;s unique potential, providing a practical perspective on how small-scale, personalized education can make a profound difference in children&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small Schools - Two Case Studies</title>
      <link>http://localhost:53445/project/small-schools-case-studies/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:53445/project/small-schools-case-studies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This detailed case study examines two small schools, providing an in-depth look at their educational philosophies, teaching approaches, organizational structures, and community impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my extensive research during my journey visiting fifteen small schools affiliated with Human Scale Education, these case studies highlight the distinctive characteristics that make small schools effective learning environments. The paper discusses how these schools address the individual needs of their students, create supportive community atmospheres, and navigate the challenges of operating outside mainstream educational systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research compares different models of small school education while identifying common factors that contribute to their success. It also considers the implications for broader educational policy and practice, suggesting how elements from small schools might inform improvements in mainstream education.&lt;/p&gt;
