      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why I Started a Small School&amp;rdquo; is the culmination of my life&amp;rsquo;s work in education, sharing the story of how I created an educational environment focused on individual needs. The book offers insights into alternative approaches to education, especially for children who have not thrived in conventional school settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative draws from my diverse experiences including working with struggling students, teenagers in care, running a children&amp;rsquo;s nursery, home educating my own children, and ultimately establishing a small school. It chronicles the challenges, rewards, and lessons learned throughout this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book reflects my belief in the importance of educational environments that recognize and nurture each child&amp;rsquo;s unique potential, providing a practical perspective on how small-scale, personalized education can make a profound difference in children&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
