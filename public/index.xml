      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book, the first in a series of three, tells my personal story leading up to the opening of the small school. It demonstrates some of the failings of the education system and highlights the need for alternative approaches. The story will appeal to childcare professionals, teachers, parents and anybody who enjoys reading memoirs and narrative non-fiction. Following its release as an ebook it received excellent reviews and became an Amazon Number 1 Best Seller.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With over 25 years teaching experience, my lifetime&amp;rsquo;s work has involved finding ways of helping individuals to succeed, ranging from young children struggling to survive in mainstream education and teenagers in care, to setting up and running a children&amp;rsquo;s nursery, and then a non-fee paying &amp;lsquo;alternative&amp;rsquo; small school. I have also had the enlightening experience of home educating my own two children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to spread the word about alternative approaches to mainstream education, I visited all the small schools affiliated to the national organisation Human Scale Education during the summer term of 1997. Together with my two children, then aged 8 and 13, I travelled around England and Scotland in a caravan for ten weeks visiting fifteen small schools. This trip was a pivotal factor in kick starting my writing career as well as being the basis for my Masters Degree in Education by Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my children have long since left home, and I remarried in 2011. I spend my free time taking photographs, playing classical guitar, swimming, and of course, writing.&lt;/p&gt;
