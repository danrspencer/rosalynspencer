      <description>&lt;p&gt;With over 25 years teaching experience, my lifetime&amp;rsquo;s work has involved finding ways of helping individuals to succeed, ranging from young children struggling to survive in mainstream education and teenagers in care, to setting up and running a children&amp;rsquo;s nursery, and then a non-fee paying &amp;lsquo;alternative&amp;rsquo; small school. I have also had the enlightening experience of home educating my own two children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to spread the word about alternative approaches to mainstream education, I visited all the small schools affiliated to the national organisation Human Scale Education during the summer term of 1997. Together with my two children, then aged 8 and 13, I travelled around England and Scotland in a caravan for ten weeks visiting fifteen small schools. This trip was a pivotal factor in kick starting my writing career as well as being the basis for my Masters Degree in Education by Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my children have long since left home, and I remarried in 2011. I spend my free time taking photographs, playing classical guitar, swimming, and of course, writing.&lt;/p&gt;
