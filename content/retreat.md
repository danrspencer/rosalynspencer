Come and spend two or more days working on your writing project in peaceful surroundings while being completely looked-after with home-cooked plant-based meals and cakes. Enjoy the comfortable surroundings while you write in your own room, the lounge, the snug, outside under the covered pergola, the summerhouse overlooking the pond, or other writing areas around the garden. Whenever you fancy a break, you have a variety of local walks on the doorstep to enjoy the countryside, local farm animals and views of Skiddaw. Or you can take a short drive (or bus-ride) to enjoy the Lake District National Park with areas of outstanding natural beauty – which can be inspirational for the creative process of writing!

Short structured breaks with facilitated workshops for groups of up to six writers are also available – click here for details.
