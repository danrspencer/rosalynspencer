"Why I Started a Small School" tells the story of my journey in setting up and running a non-fee paying 'alternative' small school. This book draws from my extensive experience of over 25 years in teaching, working with children from various backgrounds and educational needs.

The book explores the challenges and rewards of creating an educational environment that focuses on the individual needs of children, particularly those who have struggled in mainstream education. It shares insights from my experience visiting fifteen small schools affiliated with Human Scale Education during a ten-week caravan journey through England and Scotland with my two children.

This journey was not only pivotal in kick-starting my writing career but also formed the basis for my Masters Degree in Education by Research.
