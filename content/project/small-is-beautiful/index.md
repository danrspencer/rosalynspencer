"Small Is Beautiful" explores the philosophy and practical benefits of small-scale educational environments. Based on my experience in both mainstream education and running a small school, this article discusses how smaller educational settings can provide more personalized attention and better meet the individual needs of students.

The article draws upon my research from visiting fifteen small schools across England and Scotland, highlighting successful approaches and methodologies that foster student engagement, well-being, and academic success in these environments.
