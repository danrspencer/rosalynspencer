This detailed case study examines two small schools, providing an in-depth look at their educational philosophies, teaching approaches, organizational structures, and community impact.

Drawing from my extensive research during my journey visiting fifteen small schools affiliated with Human Scale Education, these case studies highlight the distinctive characteristics that make small schools effective learning environments. The paper discusses how these schools address the individual needs of their students, create supportive community atmospheres, and navigate the challenges of operating outside mainstream educational systems.

The research compares different models of small school education while identifying common factors that contribute to their success. It also considers the implications for broader educational policy and practice, suggesting how elements from small schools might inform improvements in mainstream education.
