"None of the schools I visited received government funding. And although some do charge fees, they are making no profits. Two of them have already been forced to close and for others, funding is a constant struggle."

This article discusses the financial challenges faced by small, independent schools based on Rosalyn's research trip visiting fifteen such schools across England and Scotland. It highlights the dedication of these educational institutions that operate without government funding, and the ongoing financial struggles they face despite their important contributions to education.
