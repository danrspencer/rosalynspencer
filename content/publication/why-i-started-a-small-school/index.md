abstract: "More than 25 years ago, long before the days of the UK's government funded free schools, Rosalyn Spencer was the driving force behind the setting up of a non-fee paying 'alternative' small school. She had felt compelled to do this, not only because of the difficulties her 9 year old son was facing in mainstream education, and painful memories of her own schooling, but also because of concerns other parents had shared with her about problems their children were experiencing. Whereas the current free schools are generously funded by the government, Rosalyn opened the school with 12 children with virtually no funding at all."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

This book, the first in a series of three, tells my personal story leading up to the opening of the small school. It demonstrates some of the failings of the education system and highlights the need for alternative approaches. The story will appeal to childcare professionals, teachers, parents and anybody who enjoys reading memoirs and narrative non-fiction. Following its release as an ebook it received excellent reviews and became an Amazon Number 1 Best Seller.
