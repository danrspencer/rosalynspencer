abstract: "This book tells the story of my journey in setting up and running a non-fee paying 'alternative' small school. Drawing from over 25 years of teaching experience, it chronicles my work with children from various backgrounds, particularly those who struggled in mainstream education. The book shares insights from my research visiting fifteen small schools affiliated with Human Scale Education during a ten-week caravan journey through England and Scotland with my two children - a journey that became pivotal in my writing career and formed the basis for my Masters Degree in Education by Research."

"Why I Started a Small School" is the culmination of my life's work in education, sharing the story of how I created an educational environment focused on individual needs. The book offers insights into alternative approaches to education, especially for children who have not thrived in conventional school settings.

The narrative draws from my diverse experiences including working with struggling students, teenagers in care, running a children's nursery, home educating my own children, and ultimately establishing a small school. It chronicles the challenges, rewards, and lessons learned throughout this journey.

The book reflects my belief in the importance of educational environments that recognize and nurture each child's unique potential, providing a practical perspective on how small-scale, personalized education can make a profound difference in children's lives.
